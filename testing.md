When trying to send actual emails from your IDE, an error stating Issue binding port will be displayed which causes sending of the email to fail. Logging issues to the terminal while developing in your IDE, as done in this video, serves to test Authentication and Authorisation functionality until project deployment.

Once deployed to Heroku, the sending of actual emails will become a possibility, so please wait until then before attempting it.
